It contains a system-level Android application using **CameraX**, **MediaPipe**, and **Accessibility Services** to control your phone with hand gestures.

## 📱 How to Create the APK (Installable App)
Since this is a native Android project, it must be compiled using **Android Studio**.

### Step 1: Open in Android Studio
1.  Launch **Android Studio**.
2.  Select **Open**.
3.  Navigate to and select this folder: `C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\CodePlay\HandLazy`.
4.  Click **OK**.

### Step 2: Sync Project
1.  Android Studio will detect the project files.
2.  It may ask to "Trust Project" -> Click **Trust**.
3.  Wait for the **Gradle Sync** (loading bar at bottom right) to finish. This downloads the necessary Android tools.

### Step 3: Build the APK
1.  Go to the top menu bar.
2.  Click **Build** -> **Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)** -> **Build APK(s)**.
3.  Wait for the build to complete.
4.  A popup will appear: "APK(s) generated successfully".
5.  Click **locate** in that popup to find your `.apk` file.

### Step 4: Install
1.  Connect your Android phone via USB.
2.  Copy the APK file to your phone.
3.  Tap it to install. 
4.  (Or simpler: Connect your phone and just click the green **▶ Run** button in Android Studio).

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions (Once Installed)
1.  Open the **HandLazy** app.
2.  Grant **Camera** permission.
3.  Click **Enable Accessibility** -> Find "HandLazy" -> Turn **ON**.
4.  Click **Enable Overlay** -> Find "HandLazy" -> Turn **ON**.
5.  Click **Start Tracking**.
6.  Raise your hand! ✋

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting
*   **"SDK Location not found"**: If Android Studio complains, open `local.properties` (it will create one) and ensure your SDK path is correct.
*   **"Drawn over other apps"**: If the cursor doesn't show, ensure the Overlay permission is granted.
